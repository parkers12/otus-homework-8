            <h2>How to get to Paris</h2>
            <p>
              Paris has been one of the five most popular tourist destinations for many
              years, about 15 million travelers flock here every year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city welcomes everyone - there are three international airports in its
              vicinity: Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Beauvais. In addition, Paris is a
              large railway junction; there are 7 train stations on its territory.
              Comfortable buses leave for the capital of France from large cities of
              Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The same type of transport is relevant for
              tourists already in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              A trip to Paris by your own car can be both more profitable than air
              travel, and quite the opposite: the savings on tickets can easily be
              “eaten up” by high prices for gasoline and hotel costs on the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Read about all the roads that lead to the most romantic city on earth on
              the page "How to get to Paris".
            </p>
            <h2>Arrondissements of paris</h2>
            <p>
              Paris is beautiful and dangerous. If you want to get acquainted with the
              first side of it endlessly, then it is better to leave the second on the
              screens in the films of Luc Besson. Of course, an unwary tourist can be
              deprived of a wallet both in the Louvre and under the shadow of the Eiffel
              Tower in the prestigious districts of the first eight, but still there is
              a clear distinction between the city into tourist and unfavorable areas,
              and it makes sense to adhere to it not only when choosing housing, but
              also in planning walking routes. Paris is not only a city of cafes,
              bakeries, antique shops, bourgeois and pretty models, it is a city of
              immigrants, multinational crime and neighborhoods where you shouldn't go
              even during the day. For more detailed information, some of which it is
              better not to check on yourself, we have collected on a special page of
              the "Arrondissement of Paris".
            </p>
            <h2>Paris hotels</h2>
            <p>
              Local hotels have a number of delicate features, for which it is better to
              be prepared in advance. Authentic Parisian hotels (and this is where
              travelers mostly tend to) are located in old Ottoman buildings. While 19th
              century houses with wrought iron grates on the balconies look great on the
              outside, inside they will delight you with cramped rooms, a tiny elevator
              (where there is any - otherwise prepare to climb a narrow and steep
              staircase) and an ancient heating system. Of course, this does not apply
              to hotels of 4 and 5 * categories, where the rooms meet all modern
              requirements - but the price starts from about 300 EUR per day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important point: the "stardom" of Parisian hotels is a rather
              arbitrary thing - it depends on a number of factors, not all of which are
              important to every tourist. For example, if you are traveling light or
              have booked a room on the ground floor, having an elevator in the hotel
              will not help you in any way - but it will add to the room rate. The same
              applies to multilingual staff - would it be of any use to you if the
              receptionist speaks Spanish? Many hotels deliberately underestimate their
              category in order to save on taxes - therefore, an expensive "kopeck
              piece" (100 EUR and more) for its class is almost always better than a
              cheap "three-ruble note" located in the same district - although in
              absolute terms the prices may be the same.
            </p>
            <h2>Transport</h2>
            <p>
              Finding a clear system in the chaos and madness of the transport system of
              Paris is the true benefactor of the thoughtful and thorough tourist. Of
              course, finding yourself without preparation on the streets of this city,
              you can easily get confused. Why are there so many tickets and passes? How
              can one not confuse the subway and the electric train underground? Why did
              the tram leave for the suburbs, and the bus rushed past the stop?
            </p>
            <p>
              Pause, inhale, exhale. Everything is strict, harmonious and logical, with
              travel cards - economical, in buses - convenient. For beginners -
              excursions along the Seine and tourist buses with an audio guide in
              Russian, freaks and aesthetes - bicycle taxis, and for those who are
              already familiar with Paris - electric cars and bicycles for rent. If you
              spend quite a bit of time in advance, then moving around the "city of
              parisians" will no longer cause difficulties. So: "Transport in Paris".
            </p>
            <h2>Rent a Car</h2>
            <p>
              Car rental in Paris has two important features: pleasant and not very
              pleasant. The good news for a car traveler is the approximately equal
              rental price within the city and airports. The bad news: Parisians have
              long been accustomed to parking "on push", small scratches and dents do
              not bother them - but the same defects will become a problem for you when
              you explain to the rental office. Hence the conclusion: full insurance
              (aka "insurance with a zero deductible") is almost mandatory, and this is
              money, and a lot - the price tag for full insurance of an economy class
              car starts from 20 EUR per day. Add in the column “expenses” about the
              same amount for paying for parking (you will not find free parking in
              Paris, unless you decide to visit the city in July-August) - and the idea
              of ​​moving around the city in a rented car will no longer seem so
              brilliant to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to the high passenger traffic at airports, profitable rental offers
              last for a few minutes, so you should take care of booking a car in
              advance - otherwise you risk getting at the counter instead of an Opel
              Corsa for 30 EUR a day some BMW X5 six times more expensive.
