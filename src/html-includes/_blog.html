    <h2>Few words about Kotor</h2>
    <p>
      Kotor has dropped an anchor between the gray mountains and the sea, and
      veiled its life behind the high and wide ramparts. Its bulwarks seem to
      have been eternally growing rock tendrils along the hill, up to the old
      fortress that overlooks the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a dramatic town where the present lives in the maze of medieval
      churches, cathedrals, Venetian palaces and pillars. Kotor is made up of
      contrasts â€“ the old squares with modern cafes, the sounds of serenade and
      live music, the echo of the footsteps down the narrow cobblestone alleys
      and the lazy purr of cats lying under the balconies with wrought iron
      railings, decorated with petunias.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, the walls of Kotor are as bright as the torches from a
      pagan ritual. When the time for carnivals comes, the streets become
      crowded, the torches become one with the fireworks, and all of Kotor
      transforms into one big spark.
