    <h2>How to get to Paris</h2>
    <p>
      Paris has been one of the five most popular tourist destinations for many
      years, about 15 million travelers flock here every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city welcomes everyone - there are three international airports in its
      vicinity: Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Beauvais. In addition, Paris is a
      large railway junction; there are 7 train stations on its territory.
      Comfortable buses leave for the capital of France from large cities of
      Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The same type of transport is relevant for
      tourists already in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trip to Paris by your own car can be both more profitable than air
      travel, and quite the opposite: the savings on tickets can easily be
      “eaten up” by high prices for gasoline and hotel costs on the way.

      the page "How to get to Paris".

    <h2>Arrondissements of paris</h2>
    <p>
      Paris is beautiful and dangerous. If you want to get acquainted with the
      first side of it endlessly, then it is better to leave the second on the
      screens in the films of Luc Besson. Of course, an unwary tourist can be
      deprived of a wallet both in the Louvre and under the shadow of the Eiffel
      Tower in the prestigious districts of the first eight, but still there is
      a clear distinction between the city into tourist and unfavorable areas,
      and it makes sense to adhere to it not only when choosing housing, but
      also in planning walking routes. Paris is not only a city of cafes,
      bakeries, antique shops, bourgeois and pretty models, it is a city of
      immigrants, multinational crime and neighborhoods where you shouldn't go
      even during the day. For more detailed information, some of which it is
      better not to check on yourself, we have collected on a special page of
      the "Arrondissement of Paris".
    </p>
    <h2>Paris hotels</h2>
    <p>
      Local hotels have a number of delicate features, for which it is better to
      be prepared in advance. Authentic Parisian hotels (and this is where
      travelers mostly tend to) are located in old Ottoman buildings. While 19th
      century houses with wrought iron grates on the balconies look great on the
      outside, inside they will delight you with cramped rooms, a tiny elevator
      (where there is any - otherwise prepare to climb a narrow and steep
      staircase) and an ancient heating system. Of course, this does not apply
      to hotels of 4 and 5 * categories, where the rooms meet all modern
      requirements - but the price starts from about 300 EUR per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important point: the "stardom" of Parisian hotels is a rather
      arbitrary thing - it depends on a number of factors, not all of which are
      important to every tourist. For example, if you are traveling light or
      have booked a room on the ground floor, having an elevator in the hotel
      will not help you in any way - but it will add to the room rate. The same
      applies to multilingual staff - would it be of any use to you if the
      receptionist speaks Spanish? Many hotels deliberately underestimate their
      category in order to save on taxes - therefore, an expensive "kopeck
      piece" (100 EUR and more) for its class is almost always better than a
      cheap "three-ruble note" located in the same district - although in
      absolute terms the prices may be the same.
    </p>
    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <p>
      Finding a clear system in the chaos and madness of the transport system of
      Paris is the true benefactor of the thoughtful and thorough tourist. Of
      course, finding yourself without preparation on the streets of this city,
      you can easily get confused. Why are there so many tickets and passes? How
      can one not confuse the subway and the electric train underground? Why did
      the tram leave for the suburbs, and the bus rushed past the stop?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause, inhale, exhale. Everything is strict, harmonious and logical, with
      travel cards - economical, in buses - convenient. For beginners -
      excursions along the Seine and tourist buses with an audio guide in
      Russian, freaks and aesthetes - bicycle taxis, and for those who are
      already familiar with Paris - electric cars and bicycles for rent. If you
      spend quite a bit of time in advance, then moving around the "city of
      parisians" will no longer cause difficulties. So: "Transport in Paris".
    </p>
    <h2>Rent a Car</h2>
    <p>
      Car rental in Paris has two important features: pleasant and not very
      pleasant. The good news for a car traveler is the approximately equal
      rental price within the city and airports. The bad news: Parisians have
      long been accustomed to parking "on push", small scratches and dents do
      not bother them - but the same defects will become a problem for you when
      you explain to the rental office. Hence the conclusion: full insurance
      (aka "insurance with a zero deductible") is almost mandatory, and this is
      money, and a lot - the price tag for full insurance of an economy class
      car starts from 20 EUR per day. Add in the column “expenses” about the
      same amount for paying for parking (you will not find free parking in
      Paris, unless you decide to visit the city in July-August) - and the idea
      of ​​moving around the city in a rented car will no longer seem so
      brilliant to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the high passenger traffic at airports, profitable rental offers
      last for a few minutes, so you should take care of booking a car in
      advance - otherwise you risk getting at the counter instead of an Opel
      Corsa for 30 EUR a day some BMW X5 six times more expensive.
