      Terms of use of the site is a document that is a road map for users, it
      regulates the relationship between the user and the owner of the project /
      copyright holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Terms of use (User agreement), it is important to settle at least
      the following legal relationships:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>conditions and procedure for using the site;</li>
      <li>
        the procedure for creating an account, as well as deleting it (including
        at the initiative of the project);
      </li>
      <li>
        detailed description of services / rules of sale and purchase and return
        of goods;
      </li>
      <li>a responsibility;</li>
      <li>intellectual property issues;</li>
      <li>
        the procedure for collecting personal data of users and working with
        them (but in fact this is another large layer of legal issues, therefore
        best practice is a separate document "privacy policy" about the presence
        and obligation of which should still be indicated in the rules of use);
      </li>
      <li>ist of actions that are prohibited;</li>
      <li>
        In the User Agreement of the site, it is necessary to describe in detail
        what functions are available that can be accessed without registration
        and what additional functionality of the site is available to users
        after registration.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Legal documents for certain categories of sites, such as blogs, may be
      considered unnecessary, but in some cases they are required and in all
      cases are very important for both you and the site visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two points are especially relevant for sites where users can post
      content. There is always a risk of receiving claims for violation of
      intellectual property rights of third parties or for the protection of
      honor, dignity and business reputation for disseminating information that
      is negative, false and subject to refutation. Indeed, in many
      jurisdictions, when considering cases where it is impossible to identify
      the defendant (author), or the information was posted anonymously, the
      owner of the site will be responsible.
